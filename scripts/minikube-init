brew install minikube
brew install kubectl

# There were some issues with virtualbox. Ended up:
1. Uninstalling and reinstalling VirtualBox. Not with brew.
2. Go to Security and Privacy, and at the bottom there's a message that you need to accept, which also triggers a restart of the computer. After that it worked.

# Default minikube VM uses virtualbox and 2 CPUs, 4G ram, 2G disk. 
minikube start

# Using minikube with multipass:
https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/12946
https://www.materialized.eu/kubernetes/minikube-on-ubuntu-in-multipass-vm-on-m1-mac/

kubectl create deployment api-auth-01 --image=florinchelaru/api-auth-01
# Or from yaml:
kubectl apply -f api-auth-01_deployment.yaml
# in the following command, port is the host port, and target-port is the container port
kubectl expose deployment api-auth-01 --type=NodePort --port=3000 --target-port=3000

kubectl get services api-auth-01
minikube ip
minikube service api-auth-01
minikube delete

# Kubernetes documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/

minikube dashboard # looks pretty awesome

kubectl apply -f spec.yaml # specify port for example or other env variables

eval $(minikube docker-env) # switch to the docker built into minikube. now when you call docker build, it will build what you have in your local dir into minikube

# Debugging what's going on with a container/deployment:
kubectl get pod -l app=api-auth-01
kubectl describe pod -l app=api-auth-01

# Kubernetes secrets, for example to get a container from a private Docker repository: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn9J9sWLj_w&list=PL2_OBreMn7FoYmfx27iSwocotjiikS5BD&index=3&ab_channel=JeffGeerling

# Editing the deployment:
kubectl edit deployment api-auth-01

# Add the following to .bash_profile to edit with sublime:
export KUBE_EDITOR="/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl -w"


# Get logs just for my app:
kubectl logs -f -l app=api-auth-01 --prefix=true

# To update to a newer version of the container:
#                            <name of deployment> <name of container>
kubectl set image deployment/api-auth-01 api-auth-01=florinchelaru/api-auth-01:1.0.2
watch kubectl get pods -l app=api-auth-01

# Get rollout history:
kubectl rollout history deployment api-auth-01

# Roll back deployment:
kubectl rollout undo deployment api-auth-01

==== Ended up not using: Helm

# Deploying with Helm: https://helm.sh/
# Helm charts publicly available: https://artifacthub.io/
# For example, the NodeJS chart by bitnami: https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/node

brew install helm
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

# Need to start minikube before the next step. To start with multiple nodes: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/
minikube start --nodes 2

helm install my-api-auth bitnami/node
